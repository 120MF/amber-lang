# Amber 🔸

> **Flow at compile time. Freeze at runtime.**

Amber is currently an experimental personal project exploring new paradigms in embedded development. Our goals are:

- Default compile-time execution of expressions, delivering surprising performance optimizations for embedded platforms
- Compatibility with traditional C/C++ language projects
- Intuitive syntax and ergonomic language design

We welcome Issue submissions or PRs to discuss syntax design and feature implementation.
